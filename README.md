# Concurrent TCP chat

The main goal of this project was to create a multi-client chat system using the TCP protocol for communication.

We were able to design and build a server-side application capable of allowing the connection and communication between multiple users in real time, broadcasting the messages sent to every client connected to the same server.

On the client side, we implemented a program that allows a user to set his own username and therefore send and receive messages to and from other users.
We also included some common features, such as displaying all clients connected and a private message mechanism.

## Usage

Both apps were packaged into a JAR file using Maven.
